# 📊 NovaMart Sales Dashboard | Interactive Excel Project

Hi there! I'm Naomi, and this project is a deep dive into NovaMart's sales performance using an **interactive Excel dashboard**.

The dashboard isn't just a static report — it's fully dynamic. You can click through different **years, months, countries, and weekdays**, and the charts and numbers update automatically to reflect your selection. This means insights are at your fingertips, and you can explore the business story from multiple angles.

## 💡 Business Questions I Set Out to Answer:

1. **Which months, weekdays, or quarters are driving the most profit?**
2. **How well is NovaMart converting revenue into actual profit?**
3. **Where are we seeing seasonal dips or growth in sales performance?**
4. **Which regions or countries contribute the most to revenue and profit?**
5. **Are there clear opportunities to boost revenue or reduce costs?**

## 🔍 What the Data Revealed:

- **2008 stood out**, generating **over 92% of total revenue** – a peak year worth learning from.
- **Fridays and Sundays are the most profitable days**, with **weekdays contributing 69.5%** of total profit.
- **Quarter 2 outperformed all others** with $1.65M profit – but **Quarter 4 dropped to zero**, suggesting missed opportunities or seasonal factors.
- **Canada was the top-performing country**, with strong sales and profit margins.
- Across the years, **profit margin held at 43.1%**, indicating good control of costs (COGS).

## ✅ My Recommendations:

- **Target Quarter 4** with new strategies: promotions, product launches, or supply chain tweaks to recover lost ground.
- **Double down on high-performing days** like Friday and Sunday with time-targeted campaigns.
- **Replicate the 2008 strategy** or investigate what made it so successful.
- **Explore why Q3 and Q4 underperformed**, and fix leaks in the pipeline before scaling.
- **Use Canada’s success as a model** for other regions – it might be a testing ground for future campaigns.
