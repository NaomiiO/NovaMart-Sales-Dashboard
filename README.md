This is a hands-on project where I recreated a 4-year transactional sales dashboard using Excel. The data was messy and huge â€” over 60,000 rows across multiple tables (Products, Customers, Orders, and Regions).

The goal? To tell a clear story around profit trends, customer behavior, and overall business performance.

What I did:
Used Power Query to clean, reshape, and prepare the data

Built relationships across tables to create a solid data model

Wrote DAX formulas to make the dashboard dynamic and interactive

Surfaced insights like seasonal spikes in sales, top-performing regions, and key customer segments
